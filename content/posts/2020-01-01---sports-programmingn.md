Also Known as competitive programming.

> Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers.

Breaking it down as easy as possible. Well, you've probably heard of high school maths contest where only correct answers count and matter, not necessarily how you come to your solution. Well, sports programming is quite similar, you choose a programming language of your choice to solve the problems and pass the tests.

So supposed you were you asked to come up with the sum of two numbers, you would do it like this using the C programming language. (Most undergraduates are taught C in the introduction to programming, that's why I chose it).

```
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main(){
     int a = 1;  // initialize variable a with the first number
     int b = 2;  // initialize variable b with theSecond number

     int sum = a + b; // initialize variable sum with the sum of a+b (1+2)

     printf("%d",&sum); // print out your sum to the console
   }
   ```
It's coming up with logic to solve this *"maths"* problem statements, where the correct or near correct solutions counts and sometimes how optimal the solutions are (*how fast the program shall run and how much memory it can use*).

[Why take part in Sports Programming ?](https://www.topcoder.com/competitive-programming-and-design/)
- Career preparation and advancement.
- Higher-quality work.
- The ability to deliver results under pressure.
- New ways of solving problems, and the ability to solve more complex problems.

You should definitely try out competitive programming this year for accelerated learning, especially if you are still in school. I will be writing more about it, check out for the next articles.
